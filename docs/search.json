    "text": "2022\n今年温哥华下雪早过东部。十一月底开始，大雪铺开盖地地来。\n下雪那天的早间，S带着孩子去了爷爷奶奶家。夜里时一人独自聆听落雪，如沙倾泻而下，打在树叶上，沙沙沙。突然之间有种惊奇的感觉。这种惊异感让从沉湎的抑郁与孤单中走出来。是的，我从小自觉孤单。从五年级开始寄宿学校，每每回到家中，看见弟弟与父母亲近异常，恍如外人。也曾一人人伤心，可孩子的伤心是无处去的，只能掩埋起来。长大的，更是形单影只。\n幸有诗书一路相伴。幼时读书，为的是乐趣。年长了读书，务实的时候多。有时，为了安慰自己的孤寂灵魂。更多是向其它人学习取经。可是后者，向来都是头脑的劳动，而不是心灵的愉悦。书写却不一样。书写是为了理清思绪，安抚与接近自己。更像是拥抱自己。\n一直以来，期待有孩子的陪伴。结婚生子，争吵磨合，如蛙养珠一样。然而，这颗珠也是靠不住的。孩子才三岁，已经很有主见，开始让我伤心难过。怕她孤单怕她厌烦，时刻为她担忧。换来一句我不想和妈妈说话。或不要妈妈。她有自己的乐趣，生活，和选择。我将她放第一位。现在开始，她已经将我排在各色事务之后。长大后不 知要让我伤心多少次。难过，但是也无用。\n人之一生，孤独是注定了的。我犹如此。所以，开了博客，继续写。写完了，再继续前进。不然又能怎么样呢。"

    "text": "Concluded 2022 by watching Avatar 2: The Way of Water. I do not regret to watch it. It is a bit lenthy, over 3 hours, but it is not tedious. The plot is full of suspense and tension, on top of the impressive visual effect, which brings to life an abundance of imaginary creatures under water. To be honest, I hesitated to even go to washroom so that I did not miss any scene.\nHowever, in contrast to the intrinsic visual vividness, the weak story line become quite obvious. I do not want to mention how it is basically a replica of the Avatar 1, just from mountain to ocean. I do notice that the core of the story is stemmed from the historical and tragic encounters of American Indian and European colonizers, just overly romanticized.\nHow come an arrow can pears through the window of the helicopter sent to outer space ? The most intelligent creature, Tabu, in the sea, can tear down human ship using their own rope, meanwhile the brains of its peers s were drilled into and drained for sell on Earth. It is just unrealistic. I understand the reason behind this unrealistics - to appeal for the human conscience. To show people that the beauty, the kind, the innocent, the justice will always win. Kind of balancing out the reality. As we all trained in such a way by society, so we stay kind, innocent, and consider this is the justice in life.\nUnfortunately, this romanization only reminds me again and again how the encounters started 400 years ago ended. Brutally. The bows and arrows injured even kills thousand of colonizers. Their strength and skills with spears was invincible at some point, especially when colonizers were just settled and ill-prepared. The rule of thumb is the gun and cannon are faster and efficient in killing massively. The steel boat and helicopters shields off the weapons from stone age. As I read history.\nThis only leave me wonder, what this movie is trying to convey here does not exist. There is a more fundamental and cruel truth: the survival of the fittest. I know some will call it Social Darwinism. However as far as I can see, the beauty surpass for now, but the most suitable survival to the last.\nLast but not the least, by presenting a distorted and sanitized version of events, the over-romanization ignores the reality and sugarcoats the events in history. And people stay comfortable with this distorted reality thus ill-prepared for it, let alone to be trained to deal with this “social Darwinism”.\n----------My own version ends here————————————–\nThe revised version by ChatGPT:\nI recently watched Avatar 2: The Way of Water and overall, I really enjoyed it. Although it was a bit long at over 3 hours, the plot kept me engaged with its suspense and tension. The visuals were also impressive, bringing to life all kinds of imaginary creatures under the water. I found myself hesitant to even go to the bathroom during the movie because I didn’t want to miss any scenes.\nHowever, the weak storyline became quite obvious in contrast to the stunning visuals. It seemed like a replica of Avatar 1, just set in the ocean instead of the mountains. While the story seemed to be based on the historical and tragic encounters between American Indians and European colonizers, it felt overly romanticized.\nI also found some elements of the movie to be unrealistic, such as the idea that an arrow could pierce through the window of a helicopter sent into outer space or that the most intelligent sea creature, Tabu, could tear down a human ship using its own rope. It seemed like these moments were included to appeal to the human conscience and show that beauty, kindness, innocence, and justice always win, but it just felt unrealistic to me.\nFurthermore, the romanticization of these encounters reminded me of the brutal reality of how they actually ended. The colonizers were killed by bows and arrows and the indigenous people’s strength and skills with spears made them almost invincible at times. However, the colonizers eventually won due to their superior weapons and technology. In my opinion, this movie seems to be trying to convey a message that doesn’t align with reality, which is that the survival of the fittest is more fundamental and cruel than the beauty that prevails for now. Some may call this Social Darwinism, but in my view, the most suitable always survive in the end.\nBy presenting a distorted and sanitized version of historical events, Avatar 2 ignores the reality and sugarcoats the brutality of the encounters between American Indians and European colonizers. This romanticization allows people to remain comfortable with this distorted reality and leaves them ill-prepared to deal with the harsh realities of social Darwinism. Instead of acknowledging the cruel and exploitative nature of these encounters, the movie reinforces harmful ideologies and fails to provide a meaningful way for people to confront and overcome these realities."

    "text": "小娃\n\n小娃昨日午间回家，抱着我说：“我想妈妈了，所以回家。”果然是解铃还须系铃人。\n其实，我一直在反省。如果父母能够感受到伤心的话，那么，更为敏感的孩子感受到的伤心失望只会更强烈。这样说来，孩子对我的推拒，也有可能是因为长久的失望。只怕她更伤心吧。\n育儿书里推崇温柔地坚持（Gentle Parenting）。原则上看起来有道理，但是操作性堪忧。一个全职工作，还有其它事务缠身的妈妈，维持温柔的能量总是储备不足。\n\n年终总结\n\n2022年伊始，开始重练英语，接受培训和帮助，修改简历，查找工作。四处投简历。其中，终于静脉输注铁。这件事很小，但是对我意义甚大。随后的时间，就是发简历，等面试。\n三月第一周，开始上高中英语写作课，一周两晚。白天带娃，参加讲座，简历，面试，一轮轮下来, 到了三月中才拿到offer。\n四月第一周进入新公司，开始工作。一开工即加班无数。几年没有连续无间断地朝九晚五六甚至七，再加上两晚上英语课。这样一来，一周总有几天都心悸不已。\n五月，以薄弱的Stata基础转R，对很多东西都不熟悉。一个很简单的工作，都耗时良久。好在终于将小娃送入Day Care。Day Care离家很近，私人性质，小娃一周去两天，还是每日哭泣着不要。继续心悸，随后预约医生。踩点动物园，小娃喜欢上长颈鹿宝宝。\n六月份，英语结课。七八月工作带娃照旧，除外多了就医无它。整个夏季的周末都在四处溜娃，几乎逛遍温村及附近城市的公园。说到溜娃，大多时候就铺上野餐垫，一人带娃一人趴着，轮班休息。\n九月份，开始刷R书籍，刷完第一本，工作流畅度提高斯多。周六周日开始上英语口语课。然而，这时候起，或者更早一些，小娃不知为何，睡眠中途总是醒来大哭，发脾气。深夜时分，半睡半醒间，小娃备受压抑的情绪如同火山喷涌而出。没有人是对，没有事情是对。我知平时陪她太少，她其实内心也伤心失望。于是强打精神，细言软语地安慰。大多时候，这一点用都没有。都是她自己完全清醒过来，才肯让好好说话。\n这样熬下来，我的睡眠时间也越来越少，越发烦燥。晚上没有睡好的娃，白天反而精神兴奋过度，而且基本失去自我调节与抑制的能力。遇到缺乏睡眠的妈妈，天天家里鸡飞狗跳。妈妈放着声量吼，小娃放开嗓子嚎啕哭。白天不开心的娃，到了该睡的时候也不肯睡，接着捱了批评，只好委屈着睡了。不高兴地睡到半夜，醒来又是一顿大发脾气。完美死循环。\n到了九月底某天，晚上只睡了三个多小时，天没亮就去医院。当晚就发烧浑身疼，终于成功被新冠清零了。其实，整个疫情期间，我们没少出门。早先还避着人，尽去户外公园。到了去年年底，有了两针疫苗加持，就存了一较高下的心了。今年五月放开，八月去公司上班，基本就没戴口罩了。这样也没一直感染。我是说，还是因为睡眠太少。\n十月开始，全家感染。还连累了爷爷奶奶。小娃烧退之后，精神好了很多，但是持续咳嗽了一个多月。至于我，ZSX一边感染，一边照料小娃，再兼顾工作，第一周精疲力尽，第二三四周还是精力不济。好在，口语课在中旬结束了。然后就到了小娃生日，简单布置家，开个小party。之后的日子，小娃随时都想唱生日歌，吹蜡烛。\n十一月，飞往美国南部小城—棕榈泉（Palm Spring）。棕榈泉位于加州，是一处沙漠中的绿洲。一直担心小娃不习惯离家在外，所以在那里只呆了一周。没想到小娃去公园，看飞机，在动物园呆得不想回家。短暂休假之后，继续工作，为各色deadline，继续加班。月末时分，一人在街边，听到悲伤异常的小提琴曲，内心大恸，痛哭了一场。其实并不是因为此小提琴代表着香港的哀鸣。\n十二月份，稍有闲暇。有空接着刷第二本R书，同时，趁着黑五，购买了个域名，用R搭建，GitHub托管，建好的自己的独立博客。这样不用担心审查，亦不用避开某些话题。至于，有无人阅读，那是另外一回事。另外，还有诸多其它事务需要处理，比如轻度参与的WHO的一个项目要分析，准备圣诞，礼物，购物季之类。一晃，又是年底。"

Beautiful, and sorrowful songs sets the theme for each case.

As someone who enjoys a good mystery with a healthy dose of suspense, I found the show to be a thoroughly enjoyable and light-hearted watch.\nOne aspect of the show that particularly stood out to me was its ability to delve into deeper societal issues, such as the experiences of indigenous people, through the lens of each case. The plot twists at the end of each episode also added an element of surprise and kept me engaged in the story.\nIn addition to the engaging plot, the music in Three Pines played a crucial role in setting the mood and theme for each case. The beautiful and sorrowful songs added to the sullen, cold atmosphere of the series, enhancing the overall viewing experience.\nOverall, Three Pines has proven to be a well-crafted show that strikes a balance between mystery, suspense, and deeper societal themes. I look forward to continuing to watch and see where the series takes me next."
