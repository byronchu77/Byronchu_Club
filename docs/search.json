So I need to restart blogging.\n\nThat is my old way of life. I log my happiness and sorrows in journal when I was younger and blog when I get older. This place is a sanctuary to me. I keep it from anyone else but strangers. No let it unseen, unread, rotten in the darkness or abundance of information. Anyway, this is my outlet.\nI need to tell myself: I am worthy. I am strong. I am loved. I take care of myself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself."
