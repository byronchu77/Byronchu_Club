###### 1. How to install Python

For mac users, start with the "Terminal", input:

``` default
    brew install python3
```

Then check if python3 is available by using:

``` default
    python3 --version
```

If you see the version info, it means the installation is successful. So, you can use it by calling it out:

``` default
    python3
```

and exit by typing in exit(). You can also install a python package like numpy:

``` default
    pip3 install numpy --user
```

###### 2 How to Install jupyter

``` default
    pip3 install jupyter
    pip2 install notebook
```

Call out jupyter notebook by

``` default
    jupyter notebook
```

The jupyter notebook will be opened in your browser.

Simple and easy ! Enjoy!
