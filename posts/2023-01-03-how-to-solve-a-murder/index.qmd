I recently watched the first four episodes of Three Pines. Overall I enjoyed it. The TV series is set in winter at a small town of Montreal, Canada. It is based on best-selling Canadian author, Louise Penny's detective series.

It is a light watch. This detective series has enough dose of suspense but not too intense, which give me room to enjoy and explore deeper about the societal causes behind murder, like the indigenous people and their lives in the first two episodes. As well, there is always small twists or big twist at the end of each episode.

I also find the musics are appealing and suits to the scene. Beautiful, and sorrowful songs sets the theme for each case. The sullen style, the coldness.

I recently had the pleasure of watching the first four episodes of the television series Three Pines, which is set in a small town in Montreal, Canada and based on the best-selling detective series by Canadian author Louise Penny. As someone who enjoys a good mystery with a healthy dose of suspense, I found the show to be a thoroughly enjoyable and light-hearted watch.

One aspect of the show that particularly stood out to me was its ability to delve into deeper societal issues, such as the experiences of indigenous people, through the lens of each case. The plot twists at the end of each episode also added an element of surprise and kept me engaged in the story.

In addition to the engaging plot, the music in Three Pines played a crucial role in setting the mood and theme for each case. The beautiful and sorrowful songs added to the sullen, cold atmosphere of the series, enhancing the overall viewing experience.

Overall, Three Pines has proven to be a well-crafted show that strikes a balance between mystery, suspense, and deeper societal themes. I look forward to continuing to watch and see where the series takes me next.
